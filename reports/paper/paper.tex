\section{Model}

We represent a city's road network with a connected graph $G = (V,E)$. Assume that each vertex $i \in V$ is associated with a weight $w_i$, representing the cost of traversing vertex $i$. A trip is represented by a path in $G$, and the distribution of the trip's duration depends on the weights $w_i$ of vertices included in the path. Note that the choice of the path can in general depend on the collection of weights $\bm W$. In full generality, the model is represented by Figure~\ref{fig:dgm}, where trips in the data are indexed by $(k)$, $T\uppr{k}$ is the observed trip duration, and $Z\uppr{k}$ is the path taken by trip $k$, a latent variable.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \caption{Representation of model as a directed graph}
  \label{fig:dgm}
  \vspace{1em}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[latent] (W) {$\bm W$};
    \node[latent, below=of W] (Z) {$Z\uppr{k}$};
    \node[latent, right=of Z] (T) {$T\uppr{k}$};
    \edge{W} {Z};
    \edge{W, Z} {T};
    \plate[inner sep=0.5em, yshift=0.2em] {ZT} {(Z) (T)} {$k=1,\ldots,N$} ;
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Parameterization}

In principle, in our application to the New York City taxi data, we may take $G$ to be a graph representing the exact road network in New York City, where each vertex is a \emph{road segment} and the directed edge $(i,j) \in E$ if one can drive directly onto road segment $j$ from road segment $i$; such a parameterization allows $w_i$ to be directly interpretable as a measure of congestion on road segment $i$. However, such a detailed construction presents serious computational challenges when training on a large dataset, since solving path-finding problems and computing minimal paths are nontrivially expensive.\footnote{Manhattan has on the order of $10^4$ road segments, and the dataset contains the order of $10^7$ trips for January 2009 alone.} 

To avoid these challenges, we parameterize $G$ as an undirected rectangular grid. Despite not being able to pinpoint weights $w_i$ to congestion of specific road segments, we are nonetheless able to interpret the weights $w_i$ as representative of congestion on a small patch of land. We may now represent a path $Z\uppr{k}$ as a set of indices $i$ of grid points traversed by the path. In full generality, there are an infinite number of paths connecting any two points $i,j$ on the grid, but the vast majority of these paths are not sensible. Thus we restrict the set of possible paths for trip $k$ to a \emph{set of reasonable paths} $\bm Z\uppr{k}$, where each path in $\bm Z\uppr{k}$ travels strictly in the direction of the destination. For instance, if the destination of $j$ is to the northeast of the starting location $i$, then the set of reasonable paths $\bm Z$ are the set of paths that only involve northward or eastward movements (e.g.~Figure~\ref{fig:reasonable}).  

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\caption{An example of a reasonable path}
\vspace{1em}

\label{fig:reasonable}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw (-0.5,0) -- (3.5,0);
\draw (-0.5,1) -- (3.5,1);
\draw (-0.5,2) -- (3.5,2);

\draw (0,-0.5) -- (0,2.5);
\draw (1,-0.5) -- (1,2.5);
\draw (2,-0.5) -- (2,2.5);
\draw (3,-0.5) -- (3,2.5);

\foreach \y in {0,1}
{
  \foreach \x in {0,...,2}
  {
    \node at (\x+.5,\y+.5) {$w_{\x,\y}$};
  }
}

\draw[line width = 12pt, opacity=.2] (0.2,.5) -- (1.5,.5) -- (1.5,1.5) -- (2.8,1.5);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure} 

We have the following model: \begin{align*}
\bm W &\sim p(\bm W) \\
Z\uppr{k} &\sim p(Z\uppr{k} | \bm W) \\
T\uppr{k} | \bm W, Z\uppr{k} &\sim \Norm\pr{\sum_{i\in Z\uppr{k}} w_i, \sigma^2},
\end{align*}

Example Structure:

\begin{itemize}
\item What is the formal definition of your problem?
\item What is the precise mathematical model you are using to represent it? In almost all cases this will use the probabilistic language from class, e.g.
  \begin{equation}
  z \sim {\cal N}(0, \sigma^2)\label{eq:1}
\end{equation}
But it may also be a neural network, or a non-probabilistic loss,
\[ h_t \gets \mathrm{RNN}(x_{t}, h_{t-1} )\]

This is also a good place to reference a diagram such as Figure~\ref{fig:diagram}.

\item What are the parameters or latent variables of this model that you plan on estimating or inferring? Be explicit. How many are there? Which are you assuming are given? How do these relate to the original problem description?
\end{itemize}
